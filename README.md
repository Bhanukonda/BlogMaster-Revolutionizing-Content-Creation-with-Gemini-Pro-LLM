Project Flow:

• Users enter their desired inputs like fitness goals, workout types etc to stay into the Streamlit UI. Additional preferences or interests can also be specified if needed.

• The input details are sent to the FitnessAI backend, which utilizes the generative AI model to process the information.

• The AI model processes the user’s input to generate a detailed and personalized fitness plan based on the specifications given by the user.

• The AI autonomously creates a well-structured and engaging fitness guide, including tips and diet to followed by the user.

• The generated sheet is sent back to the frontend of the Streamlit app for display to the user.

• Users can review the generated itinerary, make additional customizations if desired, and either export or copy the content for their fitness planning.
